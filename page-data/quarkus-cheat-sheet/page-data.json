The first framework I choose is actually <code class=\"language-text\">Micronaut</code>, but once I start investigating <code class=\"language-text\">Micronaut</code>, I realized one thing that seems important to me. It looks like <code class=\"language-text\">Spring</code>, but it's another <code class=\"language-text\">Spring</code>. Once you locked in the eco-system. it's hard to get out. So I start looking for something that is more standard so I choose <code class=\"language-text\">Quarkus</code>, backed by RedHat that implements <code class=\"language-text\">Eclipse MicroProfile</code>, that should make it relatively easy to port to other platform that also support <code class=\"language-text\">MicroProfile</code>.</p>\n<p>The more I use, the more I like it, even it is still a new framework.</p>\n<p>Things I like <code class=\"language-text\">Quarkus</code> so far</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast. It is faster then Spring. With hot reload, it’s save you lots of waiting time.</li>\n<li>Standard. It support Eclipse MicroProfile, means it uses more standard ways to do things like rest endpoint annotations, dependency injection, openapi …etc.  That also means porting to another platform should be less painful then others.</li>\n<li>Easy to learn. It’s similar to Spring, if you have some Spring background, should be really easy to pick up.</li>\n<li>GraalVM supports. Building native images is build-in, it could significantly reduce the startup time and memory usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Things I thing it can improve</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Building with <code class=\"language-text\">Gradle</code> is still in progress. I just hit some known issue and have to switch to Maven.</li>\n<li>IDE support is not as good as Spring. It’s Ok, but still needs a bit of setup in order to get debugger working.</li>\n</ul>","id":"9ea1209c-d7e8-549b-91b5-311f639340a9","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-03-02T04:18:56.083Z","path":"/quarkus-and-spring","tags":["quarkus","spring","microservice","mircoprofile"],"title":"Quarkus And Spring"}}}}}
