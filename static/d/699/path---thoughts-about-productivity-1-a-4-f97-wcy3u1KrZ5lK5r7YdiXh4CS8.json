But to an ordanary developer like myself, can only vaguely remember how to do this few weeks later. So what ends up is, I alwasy need to check the README or whatever that document the process. This is a distraction. A distraction will end up lots of mental cost, including context switching.\nA developer might developing a feature and just want to know wheather his code will pass the e2e tests, but now he has forced to switch context to learn how to run the tests again.\nIf these steps can be run in a single command, like <code class=\"language-text\">npm run e2e-test</code>, then it is a way better improvement in terms of distraction. A single command is way easy to remember than a sequnce of commands.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Scripting all simple process if possible.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 08, 2018","path":"/thoughts-about-productivity","tags":["productivity"],"title":"Thoughts About Productivity"}}},"pageContext":{"prev":{"excerpt":"Looking At The Root Problem Example, the translation fallback logic in the code.
