But lots of time, the solution is not perfect and you need to keep coming back cause sometime it simply doesn't work. Sometimes, you need to look at the big picture, it might solve the problem entirely.</p>\n<p>Here is an example, the product I am working on has to support i18n. Means need to support multiple languages. The problem we have is we don't know when we will recieve the translations. If the translation doesn't come back by the time we ship our code, user will see some missing string when viewing in the languages other then English.</p>\n<p>To overcome this problem, we come up with an idea by adding fallback logic in our code base. If user is not viewing English, then we inject the missing translation in English. This works well, but it is time consuming. Adding the fallback logic is time consuming, removing the logic when translation came back is time consuming too.</p>\n<p>By looking at the problem again, we found we can simply using webpack plugin to merge the translation file, all the missing string in the translation files will be replace with English string. This only took me few hours to implement, but the on going cost of adding and removing fallback logic is uncountable.</p>","id":"8ce038d2-ed07-51a7-a98d-7ffcf5a693b1","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-08-09T06:34:51.232Z","path":"/looking-at-the-root-problem","tags":["probelm solving"],"title":"Looking At The Root Problem"}}],"productivity":[{"excerpt":"Thoughts About Productivity Distrative Spot any steps in thw workflow that could easily distract from your work.

But to an ordanary developer like myself, can only vaguely remember how to do this few weeks later. So what ends up is, I alwasy need to check the README or whatever that document the process. This is a distraction. A distraction will end up lots of mental cost, including context switching.\nA developer might developing a feature and just want to know wheather his code will pass the e2e tests, but now he has forced to switch context to learn how to run the tests again.\nIf these steps can be run in a single command, like <code class=\"language-text\">npm run e2e-test</code>, then it is a way better improvement in terms of distraction.

All my collections of bookmarks need to migrate, is there a proper solutions for this? It depends. But I find a website that change the way I manage my bookmarks in a nice looking UI, and it's pretty easy to use. That is <a href=\"https://start.me\">start.me</a>.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 102.44161358811041%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Start me screen shot\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/start-me-6bdc448ac18808324d38529e3d90b191-83a8b.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/start-me-6bdc448ac18808324d38529e3d90b191-8992e.png 163w,\n/static/start-me-6bdc448ac18808324d38529e3d90b191-ae0a7.png 325w,\n/static/start-me-6bdc448ac18808324d38529e3d90b191-83a8b.png 650w,\n/static/start-me-6bdc448ac18808324d38529e3d90b191-5cdf9.png 942w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p>The first thing you will notice is Start.Me is pretty much looks like a portal, things like iGoogle.

Once toggle is removed, the old code will disappear, so you are not violating DRY prinsipal any more. But you need to make sure the toggle will be removed and old behaviour will not needed.
