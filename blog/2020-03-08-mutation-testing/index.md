# Mutation Testing

[Mutation Testing](https://www.guru99.com/mutation-testing.html) - very interesting idea to verify your tests are actually testing something. Wonder if it is any good for real code.

Thinking about a big organization, the only way to track the progress and make sure the code quality meets the bar is measuring the code coverage rate, and this could be a good tool to make sure those tests are good and valid.
